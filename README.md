Below is a self-reflection I have submitted to the course provider after completing the project, which I believe will help provide background for this repository.

After going through the examples of the API resources provided in the tutorial, I decided to use the AI language learning model (LLM) API from Claude, as I was eager to learn how LLMs work and how they can be laid out programmatically. I created the basic code foundation for the LLM based on the video tutorial by Tech with Tim (available on YouTube) and embedded the code in a website using the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS suggested by Claude AI.

The code took a few iterations to reach its current state, but Iâ€™ve learned a lot from this exercise, such as setting up the LLM and the parser, configuring the prompt template, creating an agent, and developing the various tools needed to incorporate other free APIs (e.g., DuckDuckGoSearchRun and WikipediaQueryRun).

There are plenty more avenues I could explore in the future, but this has been a great introduction, and I am now familiar with how an AI API can be set up at a basic level.
